FaceCept3D: 3D Face Analysis and Recognition

## Introduction

FaceCept3D is a realtime framework for 3D face analysis and recognition. It contains a set of extendible components that can be combined to fulfil a specific task. At this step we open source the following functionality:

1. Person-specific template creation
2. Extreme head pose estimation [coming soon]
3. Facial expression analysis [coming soon]

FaceCept3D is based on the following works:

* Robust Real-Time Extreme Head Pose Estimation. ([pdf] (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6977105))

* Facial expression recognition under a wide range of head poses. ([pdf] (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7163098))

2. [Installation]

## Requirements

To install FaceCept3D you need to have the following libraries available

* ([Point Cloud Library PCL] (http://www.pointclouds.org/)) version 1.7
* ([OpenCV] (http://opencv.org/)) >= version 2.4
* ([ZeroMQ] (http://zeromq.org/))

and their dependencies.

In addition, if you plan to use a depth sensor, you will to install the driver. Currently we support only the Microsoft Kinect 1.0 sensor. However, the code can be easily extended to most of the available RGB-D sensors.

To use MS Kinect sensors:

* On windows install their ([SDK (v 1.8)] (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40278)). OpenNI driver also works on Windows

* On windows install OpenNI driver (see installation instruction)

## Installation

FaceCept3D was tested on Windows and Linux. Mac users should follow linux installation instructions.

### Windows

For Windows users we provide two ways of building and using FaceCept3D: 
* CMake
* Visual Studio .sln file

We find that on Windows using a manually generated sln file is somewhat more convenient than the one generated by CMake.
